# Customer Banking System

## Overview

The Customer Banking System is a Python application designed to help users calculate and track interest earned on savings and Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. Users can input their account details, including balance, annual percentage rate (APR), and the number of months, and the application will compute the interest earned and the updated account balances.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following Python files:

- `Accounts.py`: Contains the `Account` class with methods for setting balance and interest.
- `savings_account.py`: Contains the `create_savings_account` function to handle savings account operations.
- `cd_account.py`: Contains the `create_cd_account` function to handle CD account operations.
- `customer_banking.py`: The main script that interacts with the user and displays results.
